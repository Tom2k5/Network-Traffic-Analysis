**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is a cleartext-based, request-response and client-server protocol. It is the standard type of network activity to request/serve web pages, and by default, it is not blocked by any network perimeter. As a result of being unencrypted and the backbone of web traffic, HTTP is one of the must-to-know protocols in traffic analysis. Following attacks could be detected with the help of HTTP analysis:

- Phishing pages
- Web attacks
- Data exfiltration
- Command and control traffic (C2)
