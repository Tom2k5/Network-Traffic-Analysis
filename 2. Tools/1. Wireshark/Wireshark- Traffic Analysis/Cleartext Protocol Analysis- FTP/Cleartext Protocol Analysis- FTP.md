## **FTP Analysis**

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is designed to transfer files with ease, so it focuses on simplicity rather than security. As a result of this, using this protocol in unsecured environments could create security issues like:

- MITMÂ attacks
- Credential stealing and unauthorised access
- Phishing
- Malware planting
- Data exfiltration
